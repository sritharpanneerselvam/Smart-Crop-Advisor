# Smart-Crop-Advisor
The Crop Recommendation application that recommends the best crop to grow based on soil and climate conditions. The project involves building a machine learning model that can predict the crop yield based on several parameters such as soil pH, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and crop type. The machine learning model is then integrated into application to provide farmers with a simple and easy-to-use tool for crop selection.
